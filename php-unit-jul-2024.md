# Class Notes: PHP Unit - July 2024

## TODO
* Add classes `WidgetStorage` and `WidgetStorageTest` to `sandbox` and `completed` folders

* Q: Do the mock supporting classes allow you to limit how many times a mock method is called?
* A: Yes: see: https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/test-doubles.html#configuring-mock-objects
* A: For Prophecy you can use `shouldBeCalledTimes()` to specify a number of times it can be called

* Q: What about code coverage?
* A: See: https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/code-coverage.html

* Q: Are there any BDD test frameworks for PHP?
* A: See: https://docs.behat.org/en/latest/
* A: See: https://codeception.com/
* A: See: https://kahlan.github.io/docs/

* Q: How do you ignore ignore a test that's not complete?
* A: Use the `markTestIncomplete()` method
  * See: https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html#incomplete-tests
* A: You can also mark a test to be skipped using `markTestSkipped()`
  * See: https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html#skipping-tests
* A: There are Attributes you can use to conditionally skip tests
  * See: https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html#skipping-tests-using-attributes
* A: You can identify test dependencies using the `#[Depends('xxx')]` attribute
  * See: https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html#test-dependencies

* Q: How do you mock a static method?
* A: (from Dmitry) https://www.thecoderscamp.com/phpunit-mock-static-method/
* A: Have a look at this as well: https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/fixtures.html#global-state
* A: Note regarding built-in mock builder (https://docs.phpunit.de/en/11.2/test-doubles.html#test-doubles):
```
Please note that final, private, and static methods cannot be doubled.
They are ignored by PHPUnitâ€™s test double functionality and retain their
original behavior except for static methods which will be replaced by a
method throwing an exception.
```
* A: Suggested approaches:
  * Use the anonymous class approach to simulate the static call
  * Use this library: https://github.com/Codeception/AspectMock

* Q: What is the link to Chris Hartjes (author of this course) website?

## Homework
* Set up your source code for running the labs
* Lab: Code Kata I (FizzBuzz)

## Lab Setup
If using the VM
* Follow the instructions provided in class
If not using th VM:
* Download source file (provided by your instructor)
* Create and unzip into a `Zend` folder
* From a command prompt change to the `Zend` folder
* Run `composer update` (or `composer.phar update`)

## Class Notes
What about 0?
* (from Eduard) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MKFLCu_9bc

Data Providers:
* The provider method needs to be declared `static`
* Need to add a `use` statement when using PHP 8 attribute notation
```
use PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider;
```
When using Prophecy you need to add the composer package as follows:
* In PHP unit versions prior to 9 it was automatically included
* Now you must add the package yourself
```
composer require phpspec/prophecy
```

### Test Doubles
* Dependency Injection
  * See PSR-11: https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/
  * Also Martin Fowler's website
* Mock static method
  * (from Dmitry) https://www.thecoderscamp.com/phpunit-mock-static-method/

### Code Kata IV
The API simulation and data is located here:
```
/home/vagrant/Zend/api
```

## Errata
* http://localhost:8888/#/4/11
  * Missing ">"
  * Add 3rd arg
